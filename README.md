# This is a simple contact list(ish) application, made with MySQL, PHP and Javascript.
# You can add, remove and update contacts or view their details, if you click on the persons name. The application does not have too much details and functions. It could be probably modified, but I did not want to overcomplicate it. My main goal was to play around a bit by using pure JavaScript. I did not intend to import any JS library or framework. Also to make a CRUD app with PHP and MySQL.
# I would be pleased if you would test it out. Add, edit or remove contacts, but PLEASE don't delete all of them. :)

# WARNING! You can add you personal information, but your data will be public and i do not take any responsibilities about it's safety.
